No point in re-inventing the wheel, this is very handy:

GPL version of updated tool:

Update: attached is my copy of the script modified to use LIKE instead of REGEX. This best suited my requirement to find and replace URL's. I also added "`" style quotes for Joomla's funny use of reserved names for fields!
